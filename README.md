Code accompanying the article: _Regional, functional and transcriptomic decoding of multidimensional brain structure alterations in obsessive-compulsive disorder_

The following scripts implement the main methods used in the article:

- `univariate.py`: routines for Pearson correlation, linear regression, Freedman–Lane permutation method for linear models, and Fisher’s method for combining p-values  
- `machine_learning.py`: utilities for building predictive models on neuroimaging data with permutation testing  
- `cca.py`: canonical correlation analysis infrastructure  
- `pareto.py`: high-precision estimation of permutation-derived p-values via Pareto-tail fitting
